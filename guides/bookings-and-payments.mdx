# Bookings & Payments

Skaala's booking system lets your AI receptionist schedule appointments and collect payments automatically. This guide explains how it all works.

## How Bookings Work

### The Customer Experience

When someone calls your Skaala number and wants to book an appointment:

<Steps>
  <Step title="AI Checks Availability">
    Your AI looks at your calendar in real-time and tells the caller which time slots are open
  </Step>
  <Step title="Customer Chooses Time">
    Caller picks their preferred date and time
  </Step>
  <Step title="AI Collects Information">
    Gets name, phone, email, and any special requests
  </Step>
  <Step title="Payment (if enabled)">
    If you require payment, AI securely collects payment information
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirmation">
    Customer gets instant confirmation via SMS and email
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Behind the Scenes

What happens after the booking:
1. **Calendar Updated**: Booking appears in your dashboard instantly
2. **Time Slot Blocked**: That time is no longer offered to other callers
3. **Customer Added**: Contact is created or updated in your CRM
4. **Notifications Sent**: You and the customer both get confirmation
5. **Payment Processed**: If payment required, funds are secured immediately

<Info>
  **Real-Time Sync**: If you manually add a booking in your dashboard, the AI immediately knows about it and won't double-book that slot.
</Info>

## Booking Configuration

### Service Setup

Each service you offer needs to be configured with:

**Required Information:**
- Service name (e.g., "60-Minute Massage", "Haircut & Styling")
- Duration (how long it takes)
- Price (can be free if you don't charge)
- Description (helps AI explain it to customers)

**Optional Settings:**
- Buffer time before/after (e.g., 15 minutes between appointments)
- Specific availability (only certain days/times)
- Maximum bookings per day
- Requires deposit vs. full payment

### Calendar Rules

Control when bookings can be made:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Advance Notice">
    **Minimum**: Prevent last-minute bookings (e.g., "must book at least 2 hours ahead")

    **Maximum**: Limit how far in advance (e.g., "can only book up to 3 months out")

    **Why this matters**: Gives you time to prepare and prevents booking conflicts
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Availability Windows">
    Set when each service is available:
    - Regular business hours
    - Specific days only (e.g., "Spa treatments only on weekdays")
    - Seasonal variations

    Example: "Haircuts available Mon-Sat 9am-6pm, but premium color services only Tue-Thu"
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Capacity Management">
    Control booking limits:
    - Maximum appointments per day
    - Maximum simultaneous bookings (if you have multiple staff)
    - Block off time for breaks, lunch, admin work
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Smart Scheduling">
    Let AI optimize your calendar:
    - Group similar services together
    - Minimize gaps between appointments
    - Prefer back-to-back bookings or spaced out (your choice)
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Payment Processing with Stripe

If you want to collect payments when customers book, you'll use Stripe - a secure, trusted payment platform used by millions of businesses worldwide.

### What is Stripe Express?

**Think of it like this:** Stripe Express is your own mini payment processor, connected to your bank account. When customers pay, money goes through Stripe and directly to your bank.

**Why Stripe Express?**
- ✅ **You keep control**: Funds go to YOUR bank account
- ✅ **Fast payouts**: Money available in 2-7 business days
- ✅ **Customer trust**: They see payments are processed by Stripe (secure & familiar)
- ✅ **No middleman**: Skaala never touches your money

### Setting Up Stripe (5-Minute Process)

<Steps>
  <Step title="Connect from Dashboard">
    Go to Settings → Payments → "Connect Stripe"
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create Stripe Account">
    If you don't have one, create a free Stripe Express account:
    - Business info (name, type, address)
    - Bank account details (for payouts)
    - ID verification (required by law)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Payment Settings">
    Choose your preferences:
    - When to charge (booking time vs. later)
    - Refund policy
    - Deposit vs. full payment
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test It">
    Make a test booking to ensure everything works
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  **Important**: Stripe requires business verification for legal/security reasons. Have your business registration info and bank account number ready.
</Warning>

### Payment Options

You have several ways to collect payment:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Full Payment at Booking" icon="credit-card">
    **Best for**: Services where no-shows are costly

    Customer pays entire amount when they book. Booking is guaranteed.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Deposit Only" icon="coins">
    **Best for**: High-value services

    Customer pays partial amount (e.g., 20-50%) to secure booking. Pay rest in person.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Pay in Person" icon="building-columns">
    **Best for**: Building trust with new customers

    No payment required to book. Customer pays when they arrive. Higher no-show risk.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Mixed Approach" icon="split">
    **Best for**: Multiple service types

    Require payment for some services, allow pay-in-person for others.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Payment Flow (What Customers Experience)

**During the Call:**
1. AI mentions the price: "This service is 450 kr"
2. If payment required, AI asks: "Would you like to pay now to confirm your booking?"
3. Customer says yes → AI sends a secure payment link via SMS
4. Customer clicks link, enters card info on Stripe's secure page
5. Payment processed → Booking confirmed instantly

**Alternatively:**
- AI can take card details over the phone (if you enable this)
- Customer can pay later via link in confirmation email

<Tip>
  **Security Note**: Skaala and your AI never see or store card numbers. All payment info goes directly to Stripe's secure servers.
</Tip>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Process Refund">
    Refund appears in customer's account in 5-10 business days
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  **Refund Policy**: Clearly state your cancellation and refund policy. AI can mention it during booking: "Please note we have a 24-hour cancellation policy."
</Warning>

  </Card>
  <Card title="Easy Rescheduling">
    Let customers change time via link (avoids no-shows)
  </Card>
  <Card title="No-Show Fees">
    Charge penalty if payment was required but customer didn't show
  </Card>

Example Policy:
```
"Free cancellation up to 24 hours before your appointment.
Cancellations within 24 hours: 50% charge.

```

AI automatically mentions this when taking bookings.

## Best Practices

### For Maximum Bookings

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Keep It Simple">
    Don't overwhelm customers with too many options. Limit to 3-5 main services with clear descriptions.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Flexible Availability">
    More available slots = more bookings. Consider extended hours or weekend availability.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Easy Payment">
    Offer multiple payment options. Some customers prefer pay-in-person, others want to pay upfront.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Clear Pricing">
    No hidden fees or surprises. AI should state the exact price before booking.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### For Smooth Operations

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Buffer Time">
    Add 10-15 minutes between appointments for cleanup, setup, or running late.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Realistic Durations">
    Don't overbook by underestimating how long services take. Include customer greeting/checkout time.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Block Personal Time">
    Mark lunch breaks, meetings, and personal appointments in your calendar.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Regular Review">
    Weekly review: Which services are popular? Which time slots never book? Adjust accordingly.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Customer says payment link didn't work">
    **Check**: Is their phone number correct? Payment link sent via SMS.

    **Solution**: Resend link from booking details, or send via email instead.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Double-booking happened">
    **Cause**: Usually external calendar not syncing properly.

    **Solution**: Re-authorize calendar connection in Settings → Integrations.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Refund not showing up for customer">
    **Timeline**: Refunds take 5-10 business days to appear.

    **Check**: Look in Stripe dashboard to confirm refund was processed.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="AI offering wrong prices">
    **Check**: Service pricing in Settings → Services.

    **Solution**: Update prices, AI uses latest info immediately.
  </Accordion>
