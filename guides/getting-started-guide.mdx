# Getting Started with Skaala

Welcome to Skaala! This guide will walk you through everything you need to know to get your AI phone receptionist up and running.

## What is Skaala?

Skaala is your 24/7 AI phone receptionist that answers calls, books appointments, and helps your customers - even when you're busy or closed. Think of it as hiring a professional receptionist who never sleeps, never takes breaks, and always knows your schedule.

## Your First Steps

### 1. Create Your Account

Sign up at [skaala.ai](https://www.skaala.ai) using your email. You'll be asked to:
- Choose your business name
- Select your industry
- Pick your preferred language (Swedish, Norwegian, or English)

### 2. The Setup Wizard

After signing up, you'll meet our interactive AI setup assistant. This is where the magic happens - instead of filling out boring forms, you'll have a natural conversation with our AI to configure everything.

**What the Setup Wizard Will Ask About:**

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Your Business Information">
    - What services you offer
    - Your business hours
    - How long appointments typically take
    - Your business address (if needed)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Booking Preferences">
    - Can customers book online?
    - Do you need payment upfront?
    - How much notice do you need for bookings?
    - Should customers get confirmation emails?
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="AI Personality">
    - Should the AI be formal or friendly?
    - What greeting should it use?
    - Any specific phrases or information to mention?
    - Languages the AI should speak
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Features You Want">
    - **Booking System**: Let customers book appointments during calls
    - **Payment Processing**: Accept payments when bookings are made
    - **SMS Notifications**: AI can send text messages during calls (like "I just texted you that link!")
    - **Call Analytics**: Track all calls and see transcripts
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Tip>
  **Pro Tip**: Don't worry about getting everything perfect! You can change all of these settings later in your dashboard.
</Tip>

### 3. Get Your Phone Number

Once you complete the setup wizard, you'll get a Swedish phone number for your AI receptionist. This number is what your customers will call.

**Setting Up Call Forwarding:**

You have two options:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Forward Your Existing Number" icon="phone-arrow-right">
    Keep your current business number and forward calls to your AI receptionist. Perfect if customers already know your number.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Use the New Number" icon="phone-plus">
    Use your new Skaala number directly on your website, social media, and marketing materials.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Info>
  **Need help with call forwarding?** The setup wizard will give you the exact codes to dial based on your Swedish phone carrier (Telia, Telenor, Tele2, or Tre).
</Info>

### 4. Test Your AI

Before going live, call your new number and test it out! Try:
- Asking about your business hours
- Booking an appointment
- Asking the AI to send you information via SMS
- Speaking in different languages (if you enabled multiple)

## Understanding Your Dashboard

Once setup is complete, you'll see your dashboard. Here's what each section does:

### Overview Page
- See recent calls and bookings at a glance
- Quick stats: calls answered, bookings made, revenue earned
- Alerts for missed calls or system issues

### Bookings
- View all upcoming and past appointments
- Manually add bookings (if customer booked by phone, email, etc.)
- Cancel or reschedule appointments
- See payment status for each booking

### Contacts (CRM)
- Every caller automatically becomes a contact
- See call history for each person
- Add notes about customers
- Export contact lists

### Call Logs
- Listen to call recordings
- Read AI-generated transcripts
- See how long each call lasted
- Identify missed opportunities

### AI Assistant Settings
- Change your AI's personality and tone

- Modify what the AI says
- Add new services or update prices

### Analytics
- Track busiest call times
- Most common questions
- Booking conversion rate
- Revenue reports

## Setting Up Payments (Optional)

If you selected payment processing during setup, you'll need to connect your Stripe account:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Connect Stripe">
    Click "Connect Stripe" in your dashboard settings
  </Step>
  <Step title="Complete Stripe Onboarding">
    You'll create a Stripe Express account (takes 5 minutes)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set Pricing">
    Add prices to your services in the dashboard
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose Payment Timing">
    Decide if customers pay when booking or in person
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  **Important**: With payments enabled, customers can only book if they pay upfront. If you want to allow bookings without payment, keep "Pay in Person" mode enabled.
</Warning>

## Common Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What happens if the AI doesn't know an answer?">
    The AI is trained on your business information, but if it encounters something unexpected, it will politely tell the caller it needs to check and can either:
    - Take a message for you
    - Schedule a callback
    - Transfer the call to you (if you've set that up)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I change the AI's voice or personality?">
    Yes! Go to Dashboard → AI Assistant → Voice Settings. You can make it more formal, friendly, professional, or casual. You can also change speaking speed and tone.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Will the AI call people back?">
    Not automatically. But you can see missed calls in your dashboard and choose to call them back yourself.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I use this internationally?">
    Currently, Skaala provides Swedish phone numbers and is optimized for Swedish, Norwegian, and English. International expansion is coming soon!
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What if I already have a booking system?">
    Perfect! Skaala integrates with your existing calendar and booking systems via our API and Zapier. The AI can check availability and create bookings in your system.
