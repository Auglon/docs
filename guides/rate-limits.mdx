# Rate Limits

The Skaala API implements rate limiting to ensure fair usage and system stability.

<Info>
  **Current Limits**: 100 requests per minute per API key
</Info>

## Rate Limit Headers

Every API response includes rate limit information:

```
X-RateLimit-Limit: 100
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 95
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1704067200
```

## Handling Rate Limits

When you exceed the rate limit, you'll receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response:

```json
{
  "error": "rate_limit_exceeded",
  "message": "Rate limit exceeded. Try again in 42 seconds.",
  "retry_after": 42
}
```

<Tip>
  Implement exponential backoff when you receive a 429 response.
