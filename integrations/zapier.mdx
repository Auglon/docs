    Add filters to only process specific events (e.g., bookings over $500)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Add Delays for Sequential Actions">
    Use Zapier's delay feature for time-sensitive workflows
  </Accordion>

## Troubleshooting

### Zap Not Triggering

- Verify webhook is active in Skaala dashboard
- Check API key has correct permissions
- Ensure event type matches trigger configuration

### Data Mapping Issues

- Use Zapier's formatter to transform data types
- Add custom JavaScript code for complex transformations
- Test with sample data before going live

## Advanced: Zapier MCP Agent Integration

<Info>
**What's This?** Your Skaala AI agent can actually trigger Zapier automations DURING phone conversations! This is an advanced feature that lets your AI do powerful actions while talking to customers.
</Info>

### How It Works

When properly configured, your AI agent can:
- Trigger specific Zaps during conversations
- Pass information from the call into automation workflows
- Take actions based on what the customer says
- Update multiple systems in real-time

**Example Scenario:**

```
Customer: "Can you add me to your VIP customer list?"
AI: "Absolutely! I'm adding you right now."
→ AI triggers Zap that:
  1. Tags contact as "VIP" in CRM
  2. Adds to exclusive email list
  3. Sends notification to sales team
  4. Updates loyalty program database
AI: "Done! You'll get our VIP newsletter starting next week."
```

### What the AI Agent Can Do with Zapier

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Customer Information Management">
    - Add contacts to email marketing lists during calls
    - Update CRM records with conversation details
    - Create tasks for follow-up based on customer requests
    - Tag customers based on conversation topics
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Real-Time Notifications">
    - Notify your team in Slack when VIP customer calls
    - Alert manager when booking value exceeds threshold
    - Create support tickets from customer complaints
    - Send SMS to technician when urgent service requested
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Data Logging & Analytics">
    - Log call outcomes to Google Sheets
    - Track lead sources in Airtable
    - Update Notion databases with customer insights
    - Record interaction details in Monday.com
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Multi-System Updates">
    - Book appointment in external scheduling system
    - Create invoice in accounting software
    - Update inventory when service is booked
    - Log lead in multiple CRM systems simultaneously
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Setting Up AI-Triggered Zaps

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a Webhook Zap">
    In Zapier, create a Zap that starts with "Webhooks by Zapier" trigger
  </Step>

  <Step title="Get Webhook URL">
    Zapier will provide a unique webhook URL
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure in Skaala">
    In your dashboard, go to Settings → Integrations → Zapier MCP
    Add the webhook URL and name the action (e.g., "add_to_vip_list")
  </Step>

  <Step title="Train Your AI">
    In AI Assistant settings, tell the AI when to trigger this Zap:
    "When customer asks to join VIP program, trigger add_to_vip_list"
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test It">
    Call your number and test the trigger phrase
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Example Use Cases

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Priority Customer Routing" icon="star">
    **Trigger**: Customer identifies as existing VIP

    **Zap Actions**:

    - Notify account manager via Slack
    - Flag call for priority callback if AI can't help
  </Card>

  <Card title="Lead Capture & Distribution" icon="users">
    **Trigger**: Customer asks about enterprise services

    **Zap Actions**:
    - Create lead in Salesforce
    - Add to enterprise email sequence
    - Assign to sales rep based on territory
    - Schedule discovery call
  </Card>

  <Card title="Inventory Management" icon="box">
    **Trigger**: Customer books service requiring specific equipment

    **Zap Actions**:
    - Check inventory in Airtable
    - Reserve equipment for booking time
    - Create purchase order if stock low
    - Notify warehouse team
  </Card>

  <Card title="Emergency Escalation" icon="bell">

  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Best Practices for AI-Triggered Zaps

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Keep Triggers Simple">
    Don't create too many triggers - it confuses the AI. Limit to 3-5 key automations.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use Clear Trigger Names">
    Name triggers descriptively: "add_to_vip_list" not "zap1". AI uses these names to understand what to do.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Test Thoroughly">
    Call your number and test each trigger multiple times with different phrasings to ensure AI recognizes them.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Monitor Zap History">
    Regularly check Zapier task history to ensure automations are working correctly and not triggering unexpectedly.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Add Failsafes">
    Include filters in your Zaps to prevent actions if critical data is missing (e.g., don't add to email list without email address).
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Troubleshooting AI-Triggered Zaps

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="AI isn't triggering the Zap">
    **Possible causes:**
    - Trigger phrase too complex or ambiguous
    - AI not properly trained on when to use it
    - Webhook URL incorrect or expired

    **Solution:** Simplify trigger phrase, retrain AI with more examples, verify webhook URL
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Zap triggers at wrong times">
    **Possible causes:**
    - Trigger phrase too generic (e.g., "help")
    - Multiple similar triggers confusing AI

    **Solution:** Make trigger phrases more specific and distinct from each other
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Data not passing correctly">
    **Possible causes:**
    - Field mapping errors
    - AI not extracting data correctly

    **Solution:** Use Zapier's formatter to handle data transformation, add more structure to what AI should capture
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
